# ProcGen

This is a project that I worked on between 2015-2016, it served as my dissertation as well. I've had lot's of fun writing this code, though it's as always, not my best, but it works !.

Project currently builds only on Windows using provided build script - directly through vs compiler or indirectly through ninja.
I used Visual Studio 2016.
